**Love is awful.**

**It's awful.**

**It's painful.**

**It's frightening.**

**Makes you doubt yourself,**

**Judge yourself.**

**Distance yourself from the other people in your life.**

**Makes you selfish.**

**Makes you creepy!**

**Makes you obsessed with your hair.**

**Makes you cruel!**

**Makes you say and do thing you never thought you would do!**

**(Claire to Fleabag: There's something wrong with your priest.)**

**It's all any of us want.**

**And it's hell when we get there!**

**So no wonder it's something we don't want to do on our own.**

**I was taught, if we're born with love,**

**Then the life is about choosing the right place to put it.**

**People talk about that a lot, it feeling right.**

**"When it feeling right, it's easy."**

**But I'm not sure that's true.**

**It takes strength to know what's right.**

**And love isn't something that weak people do.**

**Being romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope.**

**I think what they mean is...**

**When you find somebody that you love...**

**It feels like hope.**
